SCRUM1-34, generate QR codes.

The ability to generate unique QR codes for a task is now possible through a button on the create task webpage. This will store the QR code as a unique identifier for the task. This QR code is generated by using the first four fields that come before the QR code generation (the place, task description, longitude, and latitude) by using these fields, the QR codes will be completely unique per task. It is important to note that a QR code will not be generated before these fields are entered, the option to create a QR code is completely optional as well. The QR codes are stored in the database as text, but they will display on the webpages as images. There are also implementations to prevent errors pertaining to the generated QR codes and webpages displaying the codes.
