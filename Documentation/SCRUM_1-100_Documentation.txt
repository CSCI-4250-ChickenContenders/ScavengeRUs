SCRUM1-100, Generate QR Code text.

It is now possible to generate qr code text for users that do not want to scan a QR code, this
text is generated with the same button as the qr code generation. This short string is stored
and associated with the task it was created with and can be entered into a new input box
added to the task completion screen. This was created by editing the create.cshtml class and
adding in the generation functionality. The delete, details, and edit pages were updated with
this new information and will properly display the qr code text. The generation also removes the
possibility of vulgar words being generated by removing vowels.
